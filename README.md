# Code test Natan Williams

POC of rewriting an existing [React app](https://github.com/doggen999/fluffy-octo-meme) to a Vue2 app.

## tl;dr

`yarn install` followed by

- `yarn dev` to start dev server...
- ...or `yarn build` to build a production bundle.

## Prerequisites

`Node v14.16.1`

`yarn v1.22.19`

# Gameplay
Select a pair of cards with the same color to win a point.

If you select an incorrect pair of card you'll lose a point. 

After each selected pair the game will freeze for 2 seconds
before you can make another move. 

Please enjoy!
